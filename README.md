# Financial Analysis & LTV Prediction for AtliQ Hardware

In this project, I work as a data analyst for a consulting agency, helping a major hardware supplier — AtliQ Hardware — analyze and optimize its sales performance using real business data.

## Goal

Perform a comprehensive financial analysis and build a customer Lifetime Value (LTV) prediction model to support strategic decision-making.

## What I Did

- Audited financial metrics including revenue, profit, and discount structures  
- Analyzed customer and product profitability  
- Identified regional and seasonal sales trends  
- Built an LTV prediction model  
- Created an interactive Tableau dashboard to present business insights


## Business Insights and Strategic Recommendations

### 1. Discounts as a Growth Lever

- A noticeable increase in discount size at the end of 2021 coincided with the highest revenue and profit recorded in the dataset  
- Strong negative correlation between discount percentage and profit margin (approximately -0.77)  
- Despite margin reduction, volume growth offset losses and led to higher overall profit  

**Recommendation:** Use discounting strategically, especially in seasonal or targeted campaigns.

### 2. Regional and Channel Profitability

- APAC is the most profitable region (over 87 million), while LATAM contributes less than 1 million  
- India and the USA are the most lucrative markets  
- Brick & Mortar and Retailer channels outperform E-Commerce and Direct/Distributor sales  

**Recommendation:** Focus on APAC, Brick & Mortar, and Retailer channels. Reassess LATAM presence and Direct/Distributor contracts.

### 3. Product Portfolio Optimization

- Several catalog products showed zero sales (e.g., Batteries, Gaming Laptops) and were excluded from the analysis  
- Top-performing categories include Internal HDD and Graphic Cards  
- The AQ Dracula HDD alone generated over 57 million in profit  

**Recommendation:** Allocate resources to high-performing SKUs and review or phase out non-performing categories.

### 4. Seasonality and Retention

- September to December shows the strongest seasonal performance  
- Retention cohort analysis highlighted the 2017-09 cohort with retention up to 60% after 50 months  
- All cohorts after 2019 show sharp drop-offs; no customer acquisition observed post-October 2019  

**Recommendation:** Align budget and operations to Q4 seasonality. Investigate the decline in new customer acquisition.

### 5. Behavioral Drivers of Retention

- Customer activity drops significantly during periods without discounts  
- Discounts positively affect not only immediate revenue but also long-term retention  

**Recommendation:** Implement structured discount programs at lifecycle milestones (e.g., months 5, 10, 25, 50) to prevent churn and extend LTV.

## Data Overview

- 67,250 sales transaction records
